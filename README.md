# Movie-Rating-Sentiment-Analysis

**Problem Statement:**
Sentiment analysis of a movie review can rate how positive or negative a movie review is and hence the overall rating for a movie. Therefore, the process of understanding if a review is positive or negative can be automated as the machine learns through training and testing the data. This project aims to rate reviews using Naive Bayes classifier.
